  name: Asaph
  backstory: "He/Him, a Math/Physics student.  Asaph unintentionally puts on an intimidating
    appearance. He tends to scowl and glare because he needs glasses, but refuses
    to ever wear them. That, in turn with being the tallest one of his friends, makes
    those who don\u2019t know him all the more wary of him. Asaph enjoys working
    out with his \u201Cbeast mode\u201D playlist that consists of Taylor Swift, BTS,
    and the occasional Mitski.  "

  relationship1: "Alex is my day one. We\u2019ve known each other since we were little,
    thanks to our familes. They\u2019re really the only person to blame for the upbringing
    of my KPOP and Taylor Swift obsession, since they were the one who constantly
    listened to it when we were little. Alex is absolutely so kind, I don\u2019t
    even think they\u2019ve ever hurt a fly before. One time, I covered an ant hill
    with sand and Alex started crying. We always sing in karaoke together with our
    families, and I\u2019m always so surprised how good of a singer Alex is, it\u2019s
    actually not fair. They don\u2019t even know the words to any Celine Dion songs
    but they still get, like, 100% on them. For New Years, we\u2019re gonna have
    another karaoke party, so you better bet I\u2019m going to outshine them for
    once."
  relationship2: "Honestly, I don\u2019t know if Autumn likes me. I thought it would
    be really cool if we became closer friends because she\u2019s the only one I
    know who listens to BTS, but I might\u2019ve frightened her a little. I even
    asked her for her bias as a joke, hopefully to loosen up some tension. I\u2019ve
    heard she can be really nice once you do get to know her though! I feel like
    maybe I try too hard when I approach her, but  I don\u2019t really know how else
    to get her to like me. Hopefully we can get a bit closer over this winter break."
  relationship3: "Cory is such a nice guy. I don\u2019t know how, but I\u2019ve never
    even witnessed him say a curse word or insult anyone. Unfortunately, he absolutely
    refuses to join me at the gym, but one day I\u2019ll get him to. We haven\u2019t
    known each other for too long, but we do get along really well. I taught him
    how to play some League, and though he had no idea what he was doing, it was
    still pretty fun, as long as we had our chats muted (Seriously, some of you guys
    need to calm down). "
  relationship4: "Rachel is pretty cool. I want to go rock climbing with her one
    day, but our schedules clash a lot. She always goes climbing late at night, when
    I prefer to work out in the morning. I\u2019d go on my own, but I don\u2019t
    really like working out alone. Plus, I\u2019ve never been climbing before, and
    I\u2019m just a littlee bit scared of heights. On another note, I heard she fixes
    phones and laptops for a cheap cost, so I tried to get my laptop fixed by her
    once. Apparently it was too full of viruses to even consider repair. Don\u2019t
    ask how that happened."
  relationship5: "Skylar and I are pretty different, and yet, I don\u2019t know anyone
    who understands me more than him. Sometimes we study together, and although I\u2019ve
    never been good at wordy kinds of subjects, he\u2019s always there to make up
    for that, and in return, I helped him with Calculus. Sometimes, he and I just
    end up talking for hours when we should\u2019ve been studying. He\u2019d always
    struggled with talking to people, though I appreciate he\u2019s always outgoing
    with me. His voice is calming enough that I feel like I could fall asleep to
    it. Not in the boring kind of way, but in a very soothing kinda way. He\u2019s
    read some pages from books he loves and I find myself completely relaxing. Sometimes,
    he\u2019ll even join me when I hit the gym, even though he hates it there, just
    because he knows I like the company. "
