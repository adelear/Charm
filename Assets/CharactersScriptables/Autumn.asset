  name: Autumn
  backstory: "She/Her, an Engineering student.  Autumn is an intelligent and honest
    individual. She values saying what\u2019s on her mind, and not everyone always
    appreciates that. Despite that, she is outgoing with her loved ones, and holds
    them close to her. At first glance, she seems like the type of person who prefers
    higher end forms of entertainment, but those who really know her know that she\u2019s
    caught up on most anime.  "
  loveInterest: Rachel

  char1: Alex
  char2: Asaph
  char3: Rachel
  char4: Cory
  char5: Skylar
  relationship1: "I don\u2019t know much about Alex, rather than the fact that they\u2019ve
    been friends with Rachel for significantly longer than me. I do think they\u2019re
    very sweet though, but perhaps a little fragile. I find myself hyperfocused on
    the words I say around them. I feel like I\u2019ll accidentally say something
    that comes across as a bit harsh, when I didn\u2019t intend it that way. I made
    a joke once about a certain show they\u2019re interested in, and it seemed to
    have upset them. I didn\u2019t realize they had no idea I was also a fan, until
    I came across them at a convention, where they were utterly shocked at how dedicated
    I was with my cosplay. We had a nice time wandering around, and I\u2019m glad
    I was able to show them the real me then. "
  relationship2: "I\u2019m not sure how to feel about Asaph. He is a tad intimidating,
    but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve talked enough for me to form a proper opinion
    on him. I was rather shocked when he shuffled close to me once while we were
    on a bus to hum along to a KPOP song I was listening to. I never thought he\u2019d
    be the type to own BTS merch, but that\u2019s what he told me during that bus
    ride as he gushed to me about his bias. I guess after that occurrence, he wasn\u2019t
    as scary as I initially thought. "
  relationship3: "Rachel can only be described as a free spirited and spontaneous
    individual. Which means she ends up hurting herself every now and then. As much
    as she likes to joke, I know that Rachel is incredibly emotional and has the
    biggest heart out of everyone I know. She gave me one of her favourite books
    once, and it was annotated with the most thorough thoughts. She also constantly
    thinks about others\u2019 feelings, and I just wish she\u2019d prioritize herself
    more. Nevertheless, it\u2019s really nice to know she\u2019ll always listen to
    what I have to say. I feel like I bore people whenever I talk, but I\u2019ve
    never felt that way with her. Even then, she always reciprocates my enthusiasm."
  relationship4: "Cory is the absolute kindest guy I\u2019ve ever met. He\u2019s
    quite literally the perfect example of the men from period dramas, who have such
    gentleman-like characteristics. The one time I tried to explain this to him as
    well, he simply nodded along and agreed. He probably had no idea what I was talking
    about, but I appreciate that he went along with it anyways. Cory and I probably
    share the same distaste for so many kinds of food. We both dislike sushi, sweets,
    and \u201Cpeasant\u201D foods like McDonalds. Overall, this man has good taste. "
  relationship5: "Skylar is an intelligent guy. He\u2019s one of the only people
    I recall who\u2019s read and shares the same interests in the same kind of books
    as me. We have this cute little tradition where we trade books every now and
    then and discuss our thoughts on them. Sometimes, we can just sit and relax in
    a library, either reading away, or sharing our thoughts for hours. We went to
    the same high school, so we often lended a hand to one another when we were stuck
    on certain topics, so it's reassuring to know he'll support me. He\u2019s also
    probably one of the only guys I know as well who has a good sense in fashion. "
