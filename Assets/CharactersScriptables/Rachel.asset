  name: Rachel
  backstory: "She/Her, A Computer Science student.  Enjoys Rock Climbing, Gaming,
    and staying up at night (regretfully). Rachel\u2019s favourite food is adobo
    and quite literally any dessert. Occasionally, she gets nosebleeds, and feels
    the need to take selfies of them. She either gives you her full attention or
    gets utterly distracted. Rachel is kind, and tries to be comedic, especially
    when it comes to helping bring others\u2019 spirits up.  "

  relationship1: "I\u2019ve known Alex since I was 14. We were in art class, and
    I noticed in their sketchbook they had drawings of characters from Avatar. They
    were the only other person at the time I knew who liked Avatar, and from then,
    we bonded over watching cartoons all the time. You understand how short they
    are, right? One time, I dared them to go into a locker to see if they could fit.
    They did. Only thing is, the principal was around the corner and started talking
    to me. Alex could only come out after 5 minutes when the conversation finally
    ended. Whoops.They\u2019re super sweet and forgave me, so maybe I can forgive
    them for borrowing my favourite book and never returning it. That was years ago,
    and I haven\u2019t seen it since. "
  relationship2: "Asaph is a very interesting guy. He looks kinda angsty and emo,
    but he very much is not like that at all. He\u2019s funny and a bit strange at
    times, but he\u2019s a good friend. He listens to KPOP and refers to himself
    as a Swiftie. One time, he tried to buy Taylor Swift resale tickets from the
    shadiest site I have ever seen, and ended up paying $200 for a virus. He asked
    me if there was any chance I could fix it , but it was far too gone. He hasn\u2019t
    used that laptop since. Poor guy. "
  relationship3: " I met Autumn just a little while back. It\u2019s crazy how we
    go to the same school, and yet I hadn\u2019t seen her all of last year. She\u2019s
    incredibly smart and I\u2019ve never seen her bomb a test. Her hair is also really
    pretty. She changes its colour every now and then. The first time I saw her in
    the library, before we became friends, she had bright pink hair that caught my
    attention. Then it faded out and became a cotton candy-like colour. Then dark
    red, and now blue. She also talks in a pretty elegant way, and gets super passionate
    when she talks about her interests. It\u2019s kinda nice to listen to whatever
    she has to say. I\u2019ve heard some people say she\u2019s a bit intimidating,
    but she\u2019d always been sweet to me.  "
  relationship4: "I don\u2019t really talk to Cory that much. I wish I could though.
    He\u2019s one of the sweetest guys I\u2019ve ever met, and we have a lot of mutual
    friends. The first time I met him, we were at a camp and had to slow dance with
    each other since everyone else had partners. I kinda left abruptly in the middle
    of it, though, and I\u2019ve felt bad about that ever since. He found me the
    next day after that just to check in on me, so that was really kind of him. I
    don\u2019t know if he remembers that time all too much. "
  relationship5: "I\u2019ve known Skylar since I was 10 years old. Granted, I don\u2019t
    talk to him as much as when we were little. We were really close back then, and
    he was the only friend back then who really got me. We\u2019d read books together,
    and argue about the silliest things. I was obsessed with Percy Jackson and The
    Maze Runner during that time, and he loved Harry Potter. Skylar was absolutely
    appalled at the fact I had never touched a Harry Potter movie, let alone read
    a single line from the books. Granted, he had never done the same with Percy
    Jackson either. He\u2019s a recent new addition to the friend group, and I can\u2019t
    help but feel awkward around him. It feels weird to know so much about someone
    for years, and then not talk or see them in a while and feel like you don\u2019t
    know them anymore."
