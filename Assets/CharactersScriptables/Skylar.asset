  name: Skylar
  backstory: "He/They, an English student.  Skylar is a quiet and soft spoken individual.
    He tends to keep to himself. When he\u2019s around others, his thoughts are always
    racing throughout his mind, and he finds it difficult to keep himself composed.
    Skylar enjoys reading, unless it\u2019s a hardcover book, which he finds difficult
    to annotate in. He always loves watching documentaries, and the occasional youtube
    theory video. "

  relationship1: "Alex is a very sweet individual. It\u2019s a pity I don\u2019t
    get to talk with them as much. I feel like they are as quiet as me, especially
    when all our friends are talking and neither of us chime in on the conversation.
    I\u2019m not very good at starting conversations. I think the only people I have
    proper friendships with are the ones who approached me first. Unfortunately,
    I think Alex and I are the same type of people who require others to start the
    conversation first. "
  relationship2: "I didn\u2019t like Asaph when we first met. I kinda thought he
    was a loud annoying jock that didn\u2019t really respect boundaries. Until one
    day, I needed a calculus tutor, and he offered to help me immediately. Turns
    out he\u2019s some kind of a math genius and not some jock whose only personality
    was liking Taylor Swift to impress girls. Turns out there\u2019s a whole emotional
    side to him that I never even noticed. Did you know he\u2019s scared of heights?
    I\u2019ve berated myself ever since we became friends for judging him based on
    his appearance. Nowadays, I find myself joining him to his little gym runs just
    because I enjoy talking to him. My anxiety makes it difficult to be able to handle
    crowds at times without feeling like wanting to combust, but he\u2019s always
    patient with me.  "
  relationship3: "Autumn is one of the smartest people I know. We get into little
    arguments over the books we read, and usually have different opinions, but hearing
    her reasoning is always interesting and incredibly insightful. We can spend hours
    just sitting in silence, reading away or doing our own thing, and I really do
    also appreciate her company. She can be a bit too honest at times, but I truly
    do value her opinion. Sometimes I\u2019ll hand her my essays and she critiques
    them. Sometimes my ego does get hurt, but her comments on my work really are
    incredibly helpful. I don\u2019t like it when she critiques my outfits though.
    There\u2019s some honest opinions that sometimes, I\u2019d appreciate it if she
    lied about them. "
  relationship4: "Cory is one of the kindest people I know. It\u2019s nice to know
    someone who appreciates a quiet space like me. We don\u2019t talk often, but
    I find myself relaxing in our silence when we sit in a corner while our friends
    talk or engage in other activities. I feel like Cory is kind of a father figure
    of our group, in a non weird way. He\u2019s always driving everyone around and
    I wish I could show how much I appreciate everything he does for us, and me,
    even though he doesn\u2019t know me that well. I got him a Christmas present
    of a miniature version of his car, but I have no idea when the right time to
    give it to him would be, or how I could even give him the gift. Every attempt
    I make, I end up becoming a giant mess of words. "
  relationship5: "Rachel was one of my best friends when we were little. We shared
    all of our interests together. Sure, she never read Harry Potter, but for someone
    with an incredibly short attention span, she always listened to everything I
    said about my favourite wizard. She fell a lot as a child, and I always got her
    bandaids for them. I wish things ended up differently and I never moved away.
    Now that I\u2019m back and I see her sometimes, I can\u2019t help but feel like
    I can\u2019t talk to them anymore. I\u2019ve missed so much, how can I possibly
    catch up to who she\u2019s become? I never even took the chance to call or email
    her after I moved away, so she probably hates me or thinks I hate her."
