  relationship1: "Alex is one of the closest friends I have. We often stay up late
    just talking about absolute nonsense. They\u2019re easy to have fun with, even
    if we\u2019re in complete silence. Before we met, I knew they were really shy,
    but I\u2019ve always admired how they are always true to themselves. They put
    in a lot of passion into their interests, enough so that they can easily draw
    you into them. Now, every week, we always get together to watch the new episodes
    of whatever new show is out. Admittedly, they\u2019re always the highlight of
    my week. We both don\u2019t do well when it comes to crowds, but when they\u2019re
    by my side, a loud room is much more manageable."
  relationship2: "Asaph, in my honest opinion, is a bit of a wild card at times.
    He acts gloomy from a distance, but really, he\u2019s probably the happiest guy
    I know. I\u2019ve been told my smile is contagious, but Asaph never fails to
    make anyone laugh. He\u2019s showed me how to play some games before in the past,
    and despite how awful I am at them and how good he is, he doesn\u2019t really
    seem to care. He was just happy with the company he had. Also, I\u2019ve never
    seen anyone put so much passion into their favourite music artists."
  relationship3: "At first glance, Autumn can come off a bit harsh. But she\u2019s
    actually very kind and pretty funny. Interestingly enough, she changes her hair
    colour every now and then, so I\u2019m surprised people are shocked when she
    tells them she\u2019s into anime. Seriously, she has blue hair--I know that\u2019s
    a stereotype, but still. I can\u2019t help but feel bad when she tells me about
    things I don\u2019t really get, but I\u2019ll always try my best to understand
    them. She called me a period drama man once, and I kind of took offense to that,
    but apparently that\u2019s a compliment, so that\u2019s nice."
  relationship4: "Rachel is nice, from what I\u2019ve seen. She\u2019s always putting
    everyone before her, even if she\u2019s not too close with them. We met a while
    back during a camp, and I noticed she didn\u2019t have a partner during the dance,
    so I approached her. Unfortunately, she kinda left in the middle of it, and I
    can\u2019t blame her for that. Turned out she was just a little embarrassed,
    not by me, but the idea of dancing in a room full of people, which I totally
    agree with. We were 13 at the time, and it\u2019s nice to see her confidence
    has grown over time. "
  relationship5: "I don\u2019t really know much about Skylar. He\u2019s pretty soft
    spoken, and I know he\u2019s intelligent, but I haven\u2019t had the chance to
    talk with him as much. He\u2019s kind, respectful, but it\u2019s hard to tell
    what he could be thinking at times. The way he carries himself, he seems like
    a mystery. He helped me a couple times with some English essays, and he always
    refused to accept payment. Admittedly, I wish I had the chance to befriend him
    during that time, since he seems a bit more closed off these days. "
