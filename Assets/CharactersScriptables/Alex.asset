  backstory: "They/Them, an Animation student.  Enjoys anime, and drawing, and uses
    them as inspiration to create their own stories. Rarely ever gets more than 5
    hours of sleep, due to staying up late playing farming games at night. Their
    favourite food is anything from McDonald\u2019s, but loves Happy Meals the most.
    Alex is a calm and kindhearted individual, who many of their friends wholeheartedly
    appreciate.  "

  relationship1: "Cory\u2019s the sweetest guy I\u2019ve ever met, and anyone who
    knows him will agree on that. Sometimes we end up talking til it\u2019s 4AM,
    and realize the time when it\u2019s too late. I feel like I\u2019m usually the
    one who listens when it comes to conversations, but I find that I can talk about
    nothing and everything all at once and he\u2019ll listen to it all. Apparently
    my friend has known him for years, and I\u2019m shocked how it took us so long
    to meet, and yet, we got so close so fast. I\u2019m not really a social butterfly,
    and meeting new people can be scary for me, but Cory made it seem like a breeze.
    Asides from Rachel, he\u2019s probably my closest friend. "
  relationship2: "Rachel is a unique friend. By unique, I don\u2019t know anyone
    else who would randomly send you selfies of them with a nosebleed. She\u2019s
    the kind of friend who is either dying or getting injured every other day. Last
    month, she got a concussion from rock climbing. Nevertheless, I can always count
    on Rachel to be by my side. We met in ninth grade, and ever since then, we were
    rarely apart. We used to be on calls together every day, but ever since she\u2019d
    gotten so busy with her classes, we don\u2019t do that as often. We\u2019re still
    as close as ever, but I just wish we weren\u2019t growing up so fast and losing
    more time to hang out. Every time we do see each other though, she always bugs
    me about the book I borrowed a while back. By that way, I returned that book
    3 years ago!"
  relationship3: "Autumn is a bit of an intense person. She\u2019s really smart and
    makes that all too clear in the way she talks. I\u2019ve seen her in debate meets
    since my sister used to do that, and she really does have a way with words. I
    always believed she was the type of girl who would prefer live action shows,
    dramas, maybe even prefer books rather than animated stuff, until the day I saw
    her at an anime convention. And she was in cosplay. Handmade. We talked briefly,
    and even walked around together. At the end, she bought a sword at the con. A
    sword. That just makes her all the more cooler and admirable.  "
  relationship4: "Asaph is a close family friend of mine and we usually spend our
    holidays together with our families. I\u2019ve never seen someone so passionate
    while singing Celine Dion songs during karaoke. I always get upset when I hear
    people talk about his appearance, or are afraid of him. He always has a scowl
    on his face, but he\u2019s one of the kindest guys anyone could ever meet. Plus,
    if they knew how obsessed he is with Taylor Swift, they\u2019d take it all back.
    One time, he tried to get us tickets to see her, but he was never able to land
    one. Little does he know, I\u2019m actually surprising him on Christmas with
    two seats for her show next month! I really only got them since my dad has a
    friend who has a friend who gave them for free. I\u2019m not a concert kinda
    person, but it\u2019d be cool to see just once what it\u2019s like. "
  relationship5: "I don\u2019t really know much about Skylar. He\u2019s a nice guy,
    and apparently he plays the same games and watches the same shows as me, but
    he doesn\u2019t really talk much. Sometimes, when I join in on conversations
    with him and Asaph, he ends up getting quiet. I get like that too when people
    I\u2019m not familiar with do the same, so I can\u2019t really blame him. He
    has a really cool sense of fashion though. I really hope I can get to know more
    about him, because from what I\u2019ve heard, he and I have a lot in common. "
