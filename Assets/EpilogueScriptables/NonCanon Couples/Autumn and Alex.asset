  outcome: "Alex and Autumn went to an Escape Room. The two spent the entire time
    solving separate puzzles, and rarely spoke to one another. They escaped on time,
    but quite frankly, it was one of the most boring dates they\u2019ve ever been
    on, especially when they didn\u2019t know what to talk about other than anime."
