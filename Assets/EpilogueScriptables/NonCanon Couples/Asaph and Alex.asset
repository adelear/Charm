  outcome: Alex and Asaph went to the Taylor Swift concert, where Alex got knocked
    over by another Swiftie, who then proceeded to block their view the entire night.
    Nevertheless, the date was a trainwreck. The two decided dating was super weird,
    especially since their families were so close, it felt like they were cousins.
