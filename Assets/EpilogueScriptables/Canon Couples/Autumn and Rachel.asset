  outcome: "Autumn and Rachel\u2019s first date took place at an Escape Room. They
    were extremely confident that they\u2019d solve the room before the time ran
    out, and ended up unable to complete it. Still, they had a nice time. Despite
    the fact that the love spell was supposed to give them confidence, Rachel found
    herself constantly flustered whenever Autumn got close to her as they solved
    puzzles. Autumn later admitted to her she was doing that on purpose because her
    expressions were too cute. It\u2019s been a few years, and they\u2019re moving
    in together with their dog. "
