  outcome: "Cory and Alex\u2019s first date took place at an aquarium. The two were
    incredibly shy at first, and took things step by step. Cory got incredibly nervous
    when Alex reached for his hand, but embraced the warmth of their hand against
    his. They watched the sharks, the turtles, and gushed over how adorable the penguins
    were. When Alex was admiring the fish in the tanks, they turned over and realized
    Cory was looking back at them. It\u2019s been some time now, and they have been
    living together for the past year with their cat. "
