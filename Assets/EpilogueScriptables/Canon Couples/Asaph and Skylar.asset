  outcome: "Asaph and Skylar\u2019s first date took place at a Taylor Swift concert.
    Despite preferring places that are calm and silent, Skylar enjoyed his time there
    and wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. He found Asaph utterly adorable as he
    sang his heart out to the lyrics, and found himself breaking out of his own shell
    as he sang along with him. The two then decided to have a relaxing night out
    as they sat and watched the stars together, to make up for the loud and lively
    time they had at the concert. It was a perfect compromise that the two relished
    in. Asaph and Skyler have been inseparable ever since. "
